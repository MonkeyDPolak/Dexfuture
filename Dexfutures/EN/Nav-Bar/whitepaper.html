      <br>
      <br>DexFutures allows its users to participate in option taking under the only condition of holding a WEB3 compatible portfolio.
    </div>

    <div class="Options">
      <br>
      <br>
      DexFutures allows to take an option on the performance of a token in a pool over a given time.
      <br>
      The winner option allows the user who has subscribed to it to win the sums of the users who have chosen the opposite option.
    </div>

    <div class="Pools">
      <br>
      <br>
      Pools reflect the value of two tokens, whose value is defined on the basis of a limited time and whose option lasts until the end of it.
    </div>

    <div class="Limited_time">
      <br>
      <br>
      The options taken by users are based on a fixed timer.
      <br>
      Users have until the end of the timer to take their option.
      <br>
      The options taken by all parties have a limit in the value to be retained (reference position), and in the final value. At the end of the timer, the crypto-currency with the best performance wins the game.
      <br>
      Note: in case of a global drop of the pair, the crypto-currency with the lowest performance wins the game.
    </div>

    <div class="Remuneration_fees">
      <br>
      <br>
      Users should expect a 5% fee per option.
      <br>
      The fees inherent to the use of the blockchain are independent from Dexfutures.
    </div>

    <div class="Token">
      <br>
      <br>
      The DFX token is based on the BSC CHAIN.
      <br>
      This token is proprietary to the site, and will allow holdeurs to benefit from advantages in the future.
      <br>
      <br>
      Supply : $10 B
      <br>
      <br>
      Distribution:
      <br>
      <br>
      60% sold directly.
      <br>
      This 60% will be distributed at various events.
      <br>
      <br>
      40% will be distributed at the NFT mint.
      <br>
      <br>
      Operation:
      <br>
      The DFX used for position taking will go into the site's accounts, which will make regular assignments to keep the machine running.
      <br>
      Fees: 0
      <br>
      In order to support the price once the token is launched, the disposals will only be done by batch.
      <br>
      <br>
      A 10% fee will apply in case of OTC sales, which will serve two purposes:
      <br>
      35% will go to the FuturesDex treasury and will be used to make buybacks if necessary
      <br>
      65% will go to airdrop to holders each week
    </div>

    <div class="Cash">
      <br>
      <br>
      3.5 % out of 5 % goes to the team for the management of the site.
      <br>
      1.5 % goes to a redistribution pool, with bonuses and events.
      <br>
      <br>
      All the money collected from the sale of FDX will be used initially to offer collateral for the options taken.
      <br>
      All the options taken will have a counterparty equivalent to 10 BUSD which will be made by the team until a balance is found.

        If one of the pairs in the pool makes +10%, the option is closed without time limit.

        In parallel, if a pair makes minus 10% it loses right away.
