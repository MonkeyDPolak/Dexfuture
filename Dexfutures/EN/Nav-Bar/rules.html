      <br>
      <br>Users have access to several pools, composed of 2 tokens.
      <br>
      These pools give the initial value of each of the tokens at a given time, being noted that the starting value is defined by the chronometer.
      <br>
      These values are given every day at fixed hours (xxh and xxh), and determine the limit of the option taking for the user, and the payment period for the winners.
      <br>
      The user chooses one of the tokens, and takes an option on it: it is the one of the two tokens that will have the better (or less bad) performance that will be the winning option.
      <br>
      The option contract contains the following formula:
      If the option wins, then the bets are returned to the users who subscribed to that option and the total bets of the losing options are paid to them.
      <br>
      Winning options win the total amount of the losing options bets.
      <br>
      The distribution is made between each of the winners in proportion to the options taken on the sum to be redistributed.

    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="Opttaken">
      <br>
      <br>Once the options are taken, the user's tokens are blocked until the end of the limited time (12 or 24 hours).
